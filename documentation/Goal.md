## Goal
Help new players progress fast enough before they quit the game due to low-level brawlers making them lose every game.<br><br>
If you haven't played B.S., let me explain you the issue.<br>
<img src="images/code/p11.PNG" alt="Example Image" width="340"><br>
Each brawler has these 2 stats. Health and attack. <br>
Level 1 -> 9, 3090 coins<br>
Level 9 -> 11, 4675 coins<br>
Level 7 unlocks gadgets -> 1000x2 coins<br>
Level 9 unlocks star powers and gears -> 2000x2 coins 1000x6 coins<br>
Level 11 unlocks hyper charges -> 5000 coins

In order to have an maxed account which is all brawlers lvl 11 with at least 1 star power, 1 gadget and 2 gears you need:<br>
### 1,046,730 coins

An very active free to play player will have the following monthly rewards:<br>
### 3 star drops a day
**Progression:** average 7740 coins<br>
**Time to complete:** average 12 hours<br>

### Complete brawl pass
**Progression:** 8000 coins<br>
**Time to complete:** 30 hours<br>

### Farm mastery
**! Possible for 2 months and 6 days !**<br><br>
**Progression:** 86250 coins<br>
**Time to complete:** 120 hours

### Seasonal events
**Progression:**: Roughly 20% on top of normal progression (without mastery farming and mega pig)<br>
**Time to complete:** 5-20 hours

### Mega pig
**Progression**: Max rewards: 23 star drops which equals to 1863 coins on average<br>
**Time to complete:** 1-2 hours

### Conclusion
If the player spends roughly 35 hours a month planning perfectly what and how to play and is at 56,700 trophies he will gain:<br>
`(7740+8000)*1.2 + 1863 + [(86250/120) * 35]` coins a month. Which is:<br>
**20,751** + **25,156** (the first 2 months). 

Which is 
## ***4 YEARS***

**What if we spend a little bit of money?**<br>

1. Brawl Pass plus - 10k coins a month and 150 gems
2. Level up offer - 79 gems for 3000 coins appears once per new brawler. Which is technically 5695 coins per brawl pass plus.

This get's us extra 15,695 coins a month for 10 euro. Which means we can max an account in

## 2.2 YEARS for 273â‚¬

I created this bot because the amount of grind is absurd. It takes 35 boring hours to grind the results and then you can actually have fun. Many players don't have that kind of time. The only solution for busy people is to buy the Brawl Pass Plus, play 7 hours a month, and spend 3-4 hours on the last day completing quests.
