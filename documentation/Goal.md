## Goal
Help new players progress fast enough before they quit the game due to low-level brawlers making them lose every game.<br><br>
If you haven't played B.S., let me explain you the issue.<br>
<img src="images/code/p11.PNG" alt="Example Image" width="340"><br>
Each brawler has these 2 stats. Health and attack. <br>
Level 1 -> 9, 3090 coins<br>
Level 9 -> 11, 4675 coins<br>
Level 7 unlocks gadgets -> 1000x2 coins<br>
Level 9 unlocks star powers and gears -> 2000x2 coins 1000x6 coins<br>
Level 11 unlocks hyper charges -> 5000 coins

In order to have an maxed account which is all brawler lvl 11 with at least 1 star power, 1 gadget and 2 gears you need:<br>
### 1,046,730 coins

An very active free to play player will have the following monthly rewards:<br>
### 3 star drops a day
**Progression:** average 7740 coins<br>
**Time to complete:** average 12 hours<br>

### Complete brawl pass
**Progression:** 8000 coins<br>
**Time to complete:** 30 hours<br>

### Farm mastery
**! Possible for 2 months and 6 days !**<br><br>
**Progression:** 86250 coins<br>
**Time to complete:** 120 hours

### Seasonal events
**Progression:**: Roughly 20% on top of normal progression (without mastery farming and mega pig)<br>
**Time to complete:** 5-20 hours

### Mega pig
**Progression**: Max rewards: 23 star drops which equals to 1863 coins on average<br>
**Time to complete:** 1-2 hours

### Conclusion
If the player spends roughly 35 hours a month planning perfectly what and how to play and is at 56,700 trophies he will gain:
`(7740+8000)*1.2 + 1863 + [(86250/120) * 35]` coins a month. Which is:<br>
**20,751** + **25,156** (the first 2 months). 

Which is 
## ***4 YEARS***

**What if we spend a little bit of money?**<br>

1. Brawl Pass plus - 10k coins a month and 150 gems
2. Level up offer - 79 gems for 3000 coins appears once per new brawler. Which is technically 5695 coins per brawl pass plus.

This get's us extra 15,695 coins a month for 10 euro. Which means we can max an account in

## 2.2 YEARS for 273â‚¬

And this is why I decided to create this bot. These numbers are absurd for such a fun mobile game because these 35 hours are boring, just grinding the rewards and not playing what you want. A lot of people just don't have the time to play. The only solution for people with no time is to buy the Brawl Pass Plus and play at least 7 hours for the month and the last day spend 3-4 hours to complete all quests (There are a lot of quests which are the same and you complete multiple at once).
