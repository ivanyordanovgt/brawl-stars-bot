# How to make the bot play the best
Play 3v3 on brawl ball with brawlers that can auto aim easily! Nita / Jacky / Doug etc have the best results.

# Can you get banned?
Most likely no. There are similiar bots out there that are way more blatantly playing like a bot and are fine. There's always a small risk tho.

# PC detects it's a virus?

## Short explanation:

1. Python code is converted into exe without an license, antivirus instantly finds the file suspicous 
2. The tool I use to convert into exe is very secure and hard to decompile so people who make viruses also use it so their viruses cannot be decompiled / removed etc.
However, even tho the tool makes the code not possible to decompile it has a patterns of doing these things, which the antiviruses have an dataset for. Once the antivirus sees the pattern it instantly
flags it as every possible trojan/worm etc etc.

## Long explanation

Antivirus programs scan the behavior and code of programs to identify potential threats. They follow specific rules to detect actions that might indicate harmful intent. For example, if a Python program starts making network requests, or changes files on the computer, the antivirus might incorrectly label it as a virus, even if it's perfectly safe.

Furthermore, the method used to convert Python code into standalone programs (executables) can also lead to misunderstandings. The tools that compile Python code often modify it to improve performance or protect it, but these modifications can make the program appear suspicious. This resemblance to the way malware operates can cause the antivirus to incorrectly flag these programs as dangerous.

Additionally, antivirus software uses a database of threat "signatures," which are identifiers for known malicious software. Sometimes these databases include signatures related to the tools or methods used to create both good and bad software. If a tool used to compile Python code was ever involved in making malware, any program created with that tool might get wrongly marked as a threat by the antivirus.
