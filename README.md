# Tutorial

### Bot currently only works on the "ranged" playstyle
Which means it will be only able to play these brawlers:
```py
["8bit", "barley", "bea", "belle", "bo", "bonnie",
"brock","byron", "carl", "charlie", "colette",
"colt","crow", "penny", "piper","poco", "rico",
"rt", "ruffs","dynamike", "emz", "eve", "gale",
"gene","grom", "gray", "jessie", "larry_lawrie",
"leon","griff", "gus", "lola", "lou", "mandy", "maisie",
"mrp", "nani","otis", "pam", "spike", "sprout",
"stu", "squeak""tara", "tick", "willow"]
```
Ranges are defined in the file 
```
ranges.toml
```
If you experience the bot trying to shoot enemies too far or letting enemies getting to close, you can edit it with any text editor or message me.
Other playstyles are currently worked on!

### How LDPlayer should look
Start it and press the middle button on the top right (Which maximizes the window). Do not press F11, tabs on the bottom left should be visible.

### How to start
1. Write the name of the brawler and click on the autocomplete to select it
2. Write your goal of trophies
3. Click "set"
4. After you've done that for all the brawlers you want **Open brawl stars**
5. After you are in the brawl stars lobby, click start and don't touch anything else

### How to stop the bot
Move your mouse to any corner of the screen and the bot will stop.
